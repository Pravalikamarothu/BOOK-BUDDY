# 📚 BookBuddy

**BookBuddy** is a community-focused platform for sharing and exchanging **physical books**. It connects people who want to lend, borrow, rent, or give away books they own — promoting sustainable reading habits and reducing book waste.

After reading a physical book, instead of letting it sit unused, users can upload a picture and details of the book to BookBuddy. Others nearby can then request the book for borrowing, renting, or even receiving it for free. The exchange is done physically, with arrangements made through the platform.
